# Service example

## Deploy

To deploy a separate service you need to add

```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
```

to a container with nginx

By default, no ports are added, this is for general purposes
deployment in ```echo-rest-api/deploy```, in this case
all requests go through the ```nginx-gateway``` container

```shell
docker-compose up -d --build
```
